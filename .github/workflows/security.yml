# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 📦 Security Workflow for Node.js Projects
#
# This workflow ensures supply chain security and dependency hygiene by:
# 1. Running GitHub's official Dependency Review on pull requests
#    - Detects and flags known-vulnerable packages added in PRs.
#    - Optionally comments on the PR with a summary.
# 2. Running `pnpm audit` and `better-npm-audit` on push/PR to critical branches
#    - Ensures no critical/moderate vulnerabilities are introduced in dependencies.
#
# 🔁 Triggers:
# - On push to: main, dev, staging
# - On pull requests targeting: main, dev, staging
# - Can be called as reusable workflow from other repositories
